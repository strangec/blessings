Welcome to Newsletter #1â€“soon to be reformatted, un-subscription options attached, recipients added and escaped. Perhaps, a bright yellow.

I've been stuck in bed with a stomach ache more hours than I can count this year and in the past few days have been fixated on a phrase Miles wrote to me in a letter from their own confinement, longing for "an archival body that can never be alone." I would like my body to be an archive and not a congested highway of eroded small intestines. A speedy red convertible, at the very least. Something fit for the carwash. Clearly, nonetheless, archival it is and as are yours: psycho-somatic catch-alls who, after all this time, are now in the position of receiving and sending e-mail. Phenomenal and tricky!

This is not the news but it is bits & bobs, a type of news, news for "you!" I'll try to keep it short. I'm very famous, so please don't get your hopes up...

From my archival body to yours:" class="pic">

We're back! The full moon in Aquarius has me feeling bi-weekly. I'm not quite sure what "release" can or does mean, but I imagine something similar to tossing a bright red ball to a friend with long and open arms. Messages sent and received. Today, I'm not leaving you with much, but I'm leaving you with this:

Technological (which is to say, email-specific) bells and whistles still upcoming...

The e-mail is still black-and-white and there is NO unsubscribe button. This being said, what is technological upgrade if not a recurrent, unfolding, and ambivalent promise? Keep expecting this introduction..

I'm dedicating this week to the tactile, bouncy, erratic, and slow. By which, I really mean circular? After all that, why not be thankful for the moon?

xoxo (as always)

The Weather: Today, the weather is a philosophical dilemma, thereby giving stature to their animalism, grandiloquently label their nothingness problem, which horrifies them, as a Philosophical Good, and thus gets credit for being deep...." class="pic">

Not ungrowth as in shrinkage but the un-growth that happens when you drink from the water can that sprinkles your toes and not the ground below them. A type of time-travel, really. The type of moving forward that actually unravels as it paces.

I have sweet potatoes, blueberries in yogurt, morning cereal mush in return. I imagine we share a meal revolving around tuna salad. It really is that simple and sweet!
